# 🌱 Anushka Kar – Portfolio Website (In Progress)

Hi, I'm **Anushka Kar** — a student and self-taught designer currently **learning frontend development** and UI/UX design.  
This is the **codebase for my personal portfolio website**, where I’m experimenting with web design, layout, and interaction using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

> ⚠️ This project is **still under construction**. I’m adding new sections, fixing bugs, and learning as I build. Feel free to check back later for the complete version!

## 📌 Note to Visitors

This site is part of my learning journey — no templates, no frameworks, just handwritten code and design experiments.  
I'm still learning development, but I'm **confident in my design skills**, especially when it comes to layout, visuals, and creating good user experiences.

Thanks for visiting! 🤍
